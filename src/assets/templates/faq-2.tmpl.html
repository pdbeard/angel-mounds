  Q:  What tribes lived at the site? 
</h3>
<p>
  A: The residents of Angel Mounds were the ancestors to tribes known today, although it is difficult to precisely identify which ones. They may have spoken a language ancestral to those spoken by several tribes of the Mississippi valley. In the 18th to 19th centuries, Shawnee, Miami, Potawatomi, Wea, Delaware and members of many other tribes moved through the region and used the areas around Angel Mounds.
