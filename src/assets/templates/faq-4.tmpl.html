  Q:  When was the site excavated?
</h3>
<p>
  A: Starting in 1939, under the direction of Glenn A. Black, a crew of 277 Works Progress Administration (WPA) workers began excavating the site, recovering over 2.5 million artifacts. Indiana Universityâ€™s Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology has since conducted a number of field school excavations at the site and continues to curate and research the Angel Mounds artifact collections.
