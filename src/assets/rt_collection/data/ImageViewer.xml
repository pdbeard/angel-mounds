		<description>IU hosts the annual GIS Day as an “international forum for users of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology to demonstrate real-world applications that are making a difference in our society.” GIS connects people with the geo-intelligence to work more efficiently and make better decisions. GIS supports a geographic approach to problem-solving. From Google and Bing Maps technology, to systems that monitor the spread of disease and manage environmental emergencies, GIS technologies are tools that help people do a better job and make a difference.</description><!-- Sets the image description-->

SOS is a six-foot sphere illuminated by high-definition projectors and capable of displaying a wide range of data, including oceanographic, atmospheric, astronomical, political, and economic data. IU’s SOS is installed in the atrium of the Cyberinfrastructure Building (CIB) and is now available for demonstrations and use by IU faculty, students, and staff. The event took place Sep 16-20, 2013 and featured presentations, demonstrations, and interactive sessions with local experts as well as internationally renowned journalist and artist Ingo Gunther. Mr. Gunther temporarily installed his WorldProcessor exhibit to provide additional background and inspiration for new ways to interact with and create spherical visualizations. </description><!-- Sets the image description-->

They competed against 51 qualifying teams to take home the “Robot Reliability Traveling Trophy,” which is given to the team with the lowest standard deviation for the three robot runs. They also earned the “1st Place Project Innovation Solution” trophy for the most innovative solution to the project portion of the team challenge. The team secured its spot at the championship level by winning three 1st place awards at the local level: Robot Score, Highest Robot Score Average, and Overall (out of 32 teams). </description><!-- Sets the image description-->

It begins around the center of the island and runs northward to the fjord of the Petermann glacier, and is thought to predate the ice sheet itself, which has covered Greenland for the last few million years. The feature is longer than the Grand Canyon, and as deep in some places as 2,600 feet.</description><!-- Sets the image description-->

		<description>Clinicians today do not have a reliable test to detect inclination or propensity towards suicide. They rely on indirect tests such as patient reported symptoms and feelings to decide whether someone requires immediate help and care. A quantitative test would be clinically useful for predicting and tracking suicidal tendencies and could allow clinicians to treat patients earlier. Dr. Niculescu, at the Dept. of Psychiatry, IU School of Medicine, has discovered that SAT1 mRNA levels may serve as a biomarker for suicidality when used in conjunction with other tests.</description><!-- Sets the image description-->

		<title>Scholarly: Contributing to the Annotation of the Loblolly Pine Genome</title><!-- Sets the image title -->
		<description>A critical component of a successful genome sequencing project is to discover the genes contained within the genome. This step, called gene annotation, is particularly difficult. One approach to gene annotation is to sequence the RNA molecules found in the organism, and map these assembled transcripts back onto the newly assembled genome. This is what was done, with help from NCGAS, for the loblolly pine, which is at the center of a major multi-site sequencing effort. A paper detailing this work, “Unique Features of the Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda L.) Megagenome Revealed Through Sequence Annotation,” was recently published in Genetics:http://www.genetics.org/content/196/3/891. UITS Research Technologies' bioinformatician Le-Shin Wu, working in close partnership with Indiana University faculty member Keithanne Mockaitis, provided bioinformatic assistance in running de novo RNA-sequence assemblies.</description><!-- Sets the image description-->

To improve TBI care and outcomes, information about injury, care, and outcome must be captured and analyzed. Dr. Rodgers and his staff have captured and organized these data into a REDCap registry that can be used to tease out the best ways to treat various types of TBI. In addition, the registry uses a standardized vocabulary, making the data easy to interpret and share with other researchers.</description><!-- Sets the image description-->

The computational capabilities of Big Red II, used in concert with a large, high-speed, parallel file system and reliable high-speed archive storage has permitted a breakthrough for whole genome research. This project will provide a path for recognizing disease-causing mutations as well as evaluating non-coding variations. In the long term, it will make personalized medicine possible.</description><!-- Sets the image description-->

		<title>Scholarly: Living cyberinfrastructures and their impact on scientific research</title><!-- Sets the image title -->
		<description>There are multiple impacts of living cyberinfrastructure (CI) on researchers and the science/research process itself. Free cycles mean researchers can accomplish a lot of work. In exchange, to get time on the resource, they may be required to fit into the resource’s computational model, take part in an allocations process, and justify their science. This can cut down on early experimentation. They may have to adapt their software to work on the system, share the system (and possibly their data) with other researchers, agree to provide attribution for the center, or participate in surveys or other feedback mechanisms. Centers themselves face challenges. They exist in a cooperative-competitive tension, lack adequate funding, face scaling issues that come with exascale computing, and need to attract larger communities. Thus, living CI can claim part of the scientific process.  </description><!-- Sets the image description-->
